# Python Game with Pose Estimation
A python game developed with Ursina Engine Library and implemented with Mediapipe's pose estimation framework

## Introduction
The project's purpose is to develop an exercise game by using computer and camera, or without additional equipment. It is inconvinient to have another hardware components to exercise since it costs more and is hard to apply. The main programming language is Python with [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose_landmarker/python) to detect body movement, and [Ursina](https://www.ursinaengine.org/documentation.html) to create game environment.
